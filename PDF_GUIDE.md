# How to Generate Your Resume PDF

Your resume HTML is ready! Follow these steps to create a PDF version that recruiters can download:

## Option 1: Browser Print-to-PDF (Recommended - Easiest)

1. Go to: `https://ivantran-2001.github.io/resume.html`
2. Press `Ctrl+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+P` (Mac) to open the Print dialog
3. In the printer dropdown, select **"Save as PDF"**
4. Click **Save** and choose a location
5. Name it: `Ivan_Tran_Resume.pdf`

## Option 2: Using Google Chrome

1. Visit your resume page
2. Click the **Download PDF** button on your homepage
3. This opens the resume in a new tab with print dialog
4. Select "Save as PDF" and save

## Option 3: Online PDF Converter (If needed)

1. Use a free service like: https://html2pdf.com/
2. Enter: https://ivantran-2001.github.io/resume.html
3. Download the generated PDF

## Once You Have the PDF:

- Upload it to your portfolio folder as `resume.pdf`
- Update the download button link (optional - for direct PDF download instead of print dialog)
- Share with recruiters via email or job applications

## Tips:

- Test the PDF to ensure formatting looks good
- Margins should be adequate (the HTML already has good spacing)
- File size should be under 1MB for easy email sharing
- Name format: `Ivan_Tran_Resume.pdf` or `Ivan_Tran_CV.pdf`

If you upload the PDF to the portfolio folder, I can update the download button to link directly to it!
